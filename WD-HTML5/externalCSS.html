    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <h3>I Used  External CSS Here</h3>
    <p>Both index, html and styles.css are in the same directory. <br>
         So, in the href attribute of the link tag, you can simply use styles. <br>
         css as the path, which is a relative path to the HTML file. <br>
        This setup ensures that your CSS file is included externally using a <br>
         proper path without relying on system paths.</p>
